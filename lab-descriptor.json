  "introduction": " The Metal Forming Virtual Simulation Lab (DEI) is a web-based laboratory designed to help students understand metal forming processes through interactive simulations. Metal forming involves shaping metals by plastic deformation using mechanical forces without removing material. The lab covers key industrial processes such as upsetting, extrusion, multi-step forging, hammer forging, orbital forming, hydro forming, stretch forming, sheet metal working, and ring compression tests, along with the study of upsetting and extrusion presses. These simulations enable learners to visualize material flow, deformation behavior, and the effect of process parameters in a safe and cost-effective virtual environment.",
